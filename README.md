# FizzBuzz-Python
## How to create a simple FizzBuzz structure in Python


This Python program iterates the integers from 1 to 50. 
For multiples of three, it prints "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five, it prints "Buzz". 
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five it prints "FizzBuzz".

Here are some easy steps to follow in order to achieve this:

* First of all, we take a math variable, such as the letter "x". 

* We start by giving x the value of 1.

* Then, we write a "while" and we establish the maximum value that x can have (in this case: 50).

* After that, we write the conditions that numbers must have to make our program print "Fizz", "Buzz" or "Fizzbuzz".

This way, we will create a simple python program which accomplishes the task of the *"FizzBuzz Challenge"*.
